# What is an Open Program?
An open program is a course offered in a way that anyone can interact with the source materials, prupose changes or update with the latest info. 

Luky us, it is not anymore a dream.

## Origins
In the software world is well known the concept "open source". This is when a developer (or a team) instead of hide and offuscate the source code of their softwarem, offer it open to anyone.

This helps other people to read the code, learn from it, and suggest improvements. Also, people are open to modify the code, and create their own version of the program, using the original one as the base.

What it can look like a disadvantage, is a deep strength: If everyone can update it, also can find problems your team wasn't able to, or make improvements that the original team did't thought. 

It is the power of colaboration.

## Why this matters?
Well, it is more about philosophy than any other thing. We trust that everyone in the world should have access to the same knowledege base. Has the same opportunities. And education is not an exception.

Maybe, you could just pay $50k USD to ingress a course, and get amazing skills, and make your life easier. And that's amazing. But, also, there are a lot of people that don't have this opportunity.

Instead of spending millions in paying courses to everyone, we will spend time in opening the knowledeges that allows people to start their proffessional carreer, and improve their life.

## So, is this free learning?
Maybe. We don't know yet. Maybe yes, maybe nope. For sure, is Open Learning. Which means, you will have the access to everything you learn, and you will have every update in that materials.

Also, you will be able to suggest an update to the course, so it will be better for everyone that already have passed through it, and to every new learner that will come.
